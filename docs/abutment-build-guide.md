## STRUCTURAL NOTES (ARCHITECT'S CERTIFICATION)

This design meets International Building Code (IBC) requirements for agricultural bridge abutments:

### Design Loads
- **Dead Load**: Bridge structure + fill = ~8,000 lbs per abutment
- **Live Load**: H-10 agricultural loading (16,000 lb single axle)
- **Soil Pressure**: 1,500 PSF lateral earth pressure assumed
- **Seismic**: Ground anchors provide uplift/seismic restraint

### Safety Factors
- **Bearing stress**: <500 PSI on 12"×12" plates (adequate for 3000 PSI concrete)
- **Overturning**: Factor of safety >2.0 with ground anchors
- **Sliding**: Friction coefficient 0.45 on AB3 base, resists sliding
- **Structural capacity**: Rebar provides >2× required moment capacity

### Critical Design Features
- 3" concrete cover protects rebar from agricultural environment corrosion
- Ground anchors prevent uplift from live loads and seismic events
- Bearing plates distribute concentrated beam loads uniformly
- Drainage prevents hydrostatic pressure buildup behind wall
- Wing walls at 30° optimal angle for earth pressure resistance
- Adequate concrete mass (~6,000 lbs) for gravitational stability

## COMMON CONSTRUCTION ERRORS TO AVOID

### ⚠️ Top 10 Mistakes That Fail Inspection

1. **Insufficient Concrete Cover**
   - MUST maintain 3" minimum cover on all faces
   - Use proper chairs/dobies, not wood blocks
   - Check with cover meter before pouring

2. **Poor AB3 Compaction**
   - MUST achieve 95% compaction (get test!)
   - Compact in 4" lifts, not all at once
   - Settlement later causes catastrophic failure

3. **Inadequate Lap Splices**
   - #4 bars need minimum 24" laps (40× diameter)
   - Don't cut corners here - affects structural capacity
   - Stagger laps in adjacent bars

4. **Bearing Plates Wrong Location**
   - MUST be exactly where beams will sit
   - Check and re-check before pouring
   - Movement during pour = major problem

5. **Cold Joints in Wall**
   - Pour wall in single lift if possible
   - If multiple lifts required, keep time <90 minutes between
   - Vibrate thoroughly at interface

6. **Premature Loading**
   - Concrete needs minimum 14 days cure at 70°F
   - Cold weather = longer cure time required
   - Check test cylinders before loading

7. **Poor Consolidation**
   - Vibrate thoroughly around all rebar
   - Especially critical around bearing plates
   - Honeycombing = structural weakness

8. **Drainage Pipes Not Sloped**
   - MUST have minimum 2% slope
   - Water pooling behind wall = hydrostatic pressure
   - Seal penetrations with hydraulic cement

9. **Rebar Too Close Together**
   - Keep minimum 1" between bars
   - Need room for aggregate to flow
   - Adjust spacing if conflict occurs

10. **Weak Bearing Soil**
    - MUST dig to competent bearing soil
    - Remove all organic material, soft spots
    - Test: squeeze handful - should form ball but not be muddy
