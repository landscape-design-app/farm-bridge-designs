## 🧮 Material Calculators

### How Much Do I Need for TWO Abutments?

| Material | One Abutment | Two Abutments |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| #4 Rebar (10' bars) | 14 | 28 |
| Concrete | 2.0 CY | 4.0 CY |
| AB3 Base | 0.75 ton | 1.5 ton |
| Bearing Plates | 2 | 4 |
| Ground Anchors | 6 | 12 |
| Drainage Pipe (4") | 6 ft | 12 ft |
| Total Cost | ~$1,100 | ~$2,200 |

### Waste Factors

Add these percentages for waste/mistakes:
- Rebar: +10% (2 extra bars)
- Concrete: +15% (included in 2.0 CY order)
- Form lumber: +20% (mistakes happen)
- Wire ties: +50% (they're cheap, buy extra)

## ✅ Pre-Purchase Checklist

**Before you order, verify:**
- [ ] Exact quantities calculated
- [ ] Local suppliers identified
- [ ] Delivery dates coordinated

## 💡 Money-Saving Tips

1. **Buy in bulk**: If building 2 abutments, order all at once
2. **Rent vs. buy**: Rent expensive tools (compactor, vibrator)
3. **Shop around**: Get quotes from 3 concrete suppliers
4. **Timing**: Order concrete mid-week (cheaper than weekends)
5. **Pick up**: Save delivery fees on small items
6. **Reuse forms**: If building 2 abutments, reuse lumber
7. **Group orders**: Coordinate with neighbors for bulk pricing
