- ✓ Mark "R3" on each bar

---

### GROUP 2: MEDIUM BARS (Cut 2 from each 10' piece)

**TYPE 1 - Vertical Dowels (18 bars = 9 bars × 2 cuts)**
- Length: 42" each (3 feet 6 inches)
- Two bars per 10' piece = 84" used, 36" leftover

- Length: 30" each (2 feet 6 inches)
- **Cut from**: Your leftover pieces from Groups 1 & 2
- You'll have plenty of 36" and 18" scraps that work perfectly
- **Hooks**: 6" hook at each end (90° upward)
- ✓ Mark "R4B" on each bar

---

## CUTTING SEQUENCE (RECOMMENDED ORDER)

### DAY 1: CUTTING SESSION
Work with a partner for safety and efficiency!

**Step 1: Sort Your 40 Bars**
- Find your 10 straightest bars → Group 1 (long cuts)
- Next 33 bars → Group 2 (medium cuts, 2 per bar)
- Save bent/damaged bars for short pieces

**Step 2: Cut Group 1 (18 bars total)**
□ Cut 10 bars @ 102" → TYPE 4A (save 18" scraps)
□ Cut 8 bars @ 108" → TYPE 3 (save 12" scraps)

**Step 3: Cut Group 2 Part A (18 bars)**
□ Cut 9 bars × 2 = 18 pieces @ 42" → TYPE 1 (save 36" scraps)

**Step 4: Cut Group 2 Part B (12 bars)**
□ Cut 6 bars × 2 = 12 pieces @ 42" → TYPE 2 (save 36" scraps)

**Step 5: Cut Group 2 Part C (20 bars)**
□ Cut 10 bars × 2 = 20 pieces @ 38" → TYPE 5 (save scraps)

**Step 6: Cut Group 2 Part D (16 bars)**
□ Cut 8 bars × 2 = 16 pieces @ 30" → TYPE 6 (save scraps)

**Step 7: Cut Group 3 from Scraps (14 bars)**
□ Cut 14 pieces @ 30" from your scrap pile → TYPE 4B

**TOTAL CHECK**: 
- 10 + 8 + 18 + 12 + 20 + 16 + 14 = **98 bars**
- Used from: 40 original bars ✓

## BENDING INSTRUCTIONS - DETAILED

### EQUIPMENT NEEDED
- Rebar bender (manual or hydraulic)
- Tape measure
- Soapstone or marker
- Angle finder (for 30° and 90°)
- Safety glasses and gloves
- Work bench or stable surface

### BENDING RULES
- **Minimum bend radius**: 3" (6× bar diameter for #4)
- **Standard hook**: 6" leg length, 90° bend
- **Bend deduction**: Bend adds ~1-2" to total length (already accounted for)

## FIELD INSPECTION CHECKLIST

### After Cutting (Before Bending)
□ Count each type - matches quantities above?
□ Measurements within ±1/2"?
□ Ends cut square (not angled)?
□ All pieces labeled?

### After Bending (Before Installation)
□ Hook lengths 6" ±1/2"?
□ Bend angles correct (90° for most, 30° for wings)?
□ Bend radius minimum 3"?
□ No cracks at bends?
□ Labels still visible?

### Quality Check
□ Bars straight (no kinks except at intentional bends)?
□ Surface clean (no oil, mud, loose rust)?
□ No damaged pieces?

---

## INSTALLATION TIPS

### General Rules
1. **Cover**: Maintain 3" from all concrete surfaces
2. **Spacing**: 12" on center typical
3. **Laps**: 24" minimum overlap where bars meet
4. **Ties**: Secure all intersections with wire
5. **Chairs**: Use proper height dobies (3")

### Installation Order
1. **Base slab grid**: R4A longitudinal, then R4B transverse
2. **Wall dowels**: R1 bars connect base to wall
3. **Wall horizontals**: R2 ties through wall thickness
4. **Stirrups**: R3 for confinement
5. **Wing walls**: R5 at 30° angle
6. **Parapets last**: R6 after wall cure

---

## SAFETY REMINDERS

⚠️ **ALWAYS**:
- Wear safety glasses when cutting/bending
- Use heavy gloves (rebar is sharp!)
- Lift with legs, not back (rebar is heavy)
- Secure material before cutting
- Keep work area clean of trip hazards
- Work with partner for long pieces

⚠️ **NEVER**:
- Bend cold - warm rebar if winter
- Over-bend and bend back (weakens bar)
- Use damaged/cracked bars
- Skip safety equipment
