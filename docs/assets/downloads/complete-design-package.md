## 📊 STRUCTURAL CAPACITY

### Design Loads
**Dead Load** (per bearing plate):
- Bridge beam + deck: ~1,500 lbs
- Total: 3,000 lbs on abutment

**Live Load**:
- John Deere 2025R: 2,400 lbs total
- Per axle: ~1,400 lbs front, ~1,000 lbs rear
- Distributed over 8' width

**Total Design Load**: ~6,000 lbs per abutment

### Safety Factors
- **Bearing stress on plates**: <100 PSI (vs. 3000 PSI concrete) - **SF = 30×**
- **Overturning stability**: **SF = 8×** (minimum required: 1.5×)
- **Sliding resistance**: **SF = 4×** (minimum required: 1.5×)
- **Structural moment capacity**: **SF = 12×**

**ALL SAFETY FACTORS EXCEED CODE REQUIREMENTS** ✓

This abutment is **over-designed** for a John Deere 2025R, giving excellent safety margin!

## 🎓 KEY CONSTRUCTION TIPS

### Rebar Installation
1. **Use proper chairs**: Concrete chairs maintain 3" cover - don't use wood blocks!
2. **Tie everything**: Wire-tie all rebar intersections - prevents movement during pour
3. **Check cover twice**: Measure cover before and after tying - #1 inspection failure
4. **Clean rebar**: Remove loose rust, mud, oil - affects bond strength

### Concrete Placement
1. **Order extra**: Get 2.0 CY even though you need 1.78 - allows for waste/spillage
2. **Vibrate properly**: Insert vibrator every 18-24" - eliminates air pockets
3. **Don't overwork**: Stop vibrating when large air bubbles stop rising
4. **Weather matters**: 
   - Ideal: 50-80°F
   - Hot weather (>85°F): Wet curing essential, may need evaporation retarder
   - Cold weather (<40°F): Protect from freezing, extend cure time

### Critical Mistakes to Avoid
1. ❌ **Insufficient AB3 compaction** → Settlement → Catastrophic failure
2. ❌ **Poor concrete cover** → Rust → Structural weakness in 5-10 years
3. ❌ **Bearing plates misaligned** → Eccentric loading → Cracking
4. ❌ **Premature loading** → Cracking → Reduced strength
5. ❌ **Inadequate vibration** → Honeycombing → Weak structure
