**WEEK 2: Main Body**
3. Day 4 AM: Assemble base grid (R1 + R2)
4. Day 4 PM: Install seat verticals (R3)
5. Day 5 AM: Complete seat cage (R4, R5, R6)
6. Day 5 PM: Bearing plates (R7), corners (R8)

**WEEK 3: Wings & Special Items**
7. Day 6: Assemble both wing cages (R9, R10)
8. Day 6 PM: Prepare expansion dowels (R11) - SMOOTH!
9. Day 7 AM: Drainage pipe cages (R12)

**WEEK 4: Final**
10. Day 7 PM: Quality control inspection
11. Day 8: Installation in forms

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ITEMS - DON'T MESS THESE UP!

### 1. CONCRETE COVER = 3" EVERYWHERE
- Use correct chair height
- Measure from rebar to form surface
- Inspector WILL check this

### 2. BEARING PLATE LOCATIONS
- Y = +30" and Y = -30" EXACTLY
- Elevation = 24" (top of seat)
- Mark with paint
- 10 extra stirrups each location

### 3. EXPANSION JOINT DOWELS (R11)
- 12 bars, 2' long each
- Half wrapped in plastic (NO BOND)
- Mark "NO BOND" end clearly
- Coat with form oil before wrapping
- CRITICAL: Allows wings to settle independently

### 4. ALL INTERSECTIONS TIED
- Use wire tier (faster than manual)
- Twist 3-4 times
- Bend twisted end flat
- NO EXCEPTIONS

### 5. LAP SPLICES = 24" MINIMUM
- R3 laps 6" into base
- R5 laps 6" onto R3
- Offset lap locations (stagger)

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Work at waist height** - Use sawhorses, save your back
2. **Cut all bars first** - Assembly line efficiency
3. **Practice bending** - Use 2-3 extra bars to perfect technique
4. **Tie as you go** - Don't wait until end
5. **Keep rebar clean** - Inspector will reject dirty rebar
6. **Label everything** - Confusion = mistakes
7. **Measure twice, cut once** - Classic for a reason
8. **Take breaks** - Heavy work, stay safe
9. **Photos are proof** - Document everything
10. **Ask questions** - No stupid questions in construction
