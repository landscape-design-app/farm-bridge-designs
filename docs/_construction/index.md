## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

<div style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">❌ #1: Insufficient AB3 Compaction</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Settlement after construction = catastrophic failure</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Compact in 4" lifts, get 95% compaction test</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">❌ #2: Poor Concrete Cover</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Rust within 5-10 years</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use proper chairs, check cover before AND after tying</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">❌ #3: Bearing Plates Misaligned</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Eccentric loading = cracking</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Measure three times, use laser level, verify before pour</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">❌ #4: Premature Loading</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Cracking, reduced strength</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Wait full 14 days, check test cylinders</p>
</div>

<div style="background: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">❌ #5: Inadequate Vibration</h3>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Honeycombing = weak structure</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Rent vibrator, use systematically, stop when bubbles stop</p>
